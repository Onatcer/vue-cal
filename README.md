# ‚ö° **Welcome to the new Vue Cal v5 repository!** ‚ö°

This repository contains the active development for **Vue Cal version 5**. Version 5 introduces several improvements and new features, and is the next major release of the Vue Cal library.

## üöÄ What's New in v5

- **Performance-oriented**: faster and more efficient than before
- Now very adapted and practical to use with Composition API
- Now **exposes all the date utilities** for external use
- Benefit (or not) from **Date prototypes whenever and wherever** you want: even before the calendar is created/mounted
- **Easily theme** with dark or white theme + CSS variables
- You may directly **externally preload a locale and provide it** (avoiding a promise handling)
- **All-directions sticky headers**: Sticky headers and sticky time bar at the same time - only with CSS
- **New layout with grids**, more flexible
- **New custom days view** to display a custom amount of days. The grid layout will adapt
- New **more modern default UI**
- Rewrote some options for **more intuitive** use
- More exciting stuff to come!


## Current Status: **In Development**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Vue Cal v5 is currently in active development and may not be stable for production use. Feel free to try it out and contribute!

To test the v5 version (soon in NPM) clone the repo, and run:
```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
<!-- ```bash
npm install vue-cal@next
``` -->

## Latest Stable Version (v4)

If you're looking for the stable **v4** version of Vue Cal, you can still find it in the [vue-cal-v4 repository](https://github.com/antoniandre/vue-cal-v4). Please note that v4 will no longer be actively maintained, and we encourage users to migrate to v5 when it becomes stable.

To install the v4 version via npm:
```bash
npm install vue-cal@v4
```
